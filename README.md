## Functionality

This app is designed to simulate a customer ordering a burger at a restaurant.  The user will enter the name of a burger he/she wishes to order, and it will appear in the "Not Ready" section of the page.  If the user wants to make that burger ready to eat, he/she will click the appropriate button to do so.  Once the burger is ready, it will be placed in the "Ready" column, and the user can click the button to eat the burger.
